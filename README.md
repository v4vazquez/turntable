# Turntable

[Turntable](https://v4vazquez.github.io/turntable/) is a final full-stack application capstone from the Tech Elevator boot camp. For this project we were assigned a product owner and a project manager and would complete user stories based on kanboard boards. The main idea of the project was that a user would be able to create a party or an event. From here they would be able to select a DJ and then they would be able to invite other people to an event page where they can suggest songs that they want to hear during a party. These people would be able to hit like for a song and then when a DJ logs into his page he would be able to see the songs that have been voted on. On the DJ page, the DJ can select a song to get a preview with the spotify API and can either have the song remain in the playlist or they can delete the suggestion. 

## Project specs
This project was created with a java spring backend and a vue front end. It includes a postgreSQL database and is currently being hosted by [railway.app](https://railway.app/). Changes are still being made to the project based on user suggestions and my own UX research but it can be seen [here!](https://v4vazquez.github.io/turntable-demo2/) For instructions on how to use it, view the youtube video below!
